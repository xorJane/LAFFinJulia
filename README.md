This repository contains work-in-progress translations of teaching materials from Linear Algebra: Foundations and Frontiers (LAFF) in Julia which can be downloaded, viewed on GitHub, or viewed via (nbviewer)[http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/xorJane/LAFFinJulia/tree/master/].

LAFF was created by Maggie Meyers and Robert van de Geijn at UT Austin. All materials and algorithms contained in this repo are based on their work; for now I'm altering their Jupyter notebooks from 2014 (in Python) as necessary to create content in Julia.
